# TMFP general log for blairmunroakusa

This is a log for (transparently) tracking work done for the time machine for peace invention program. Entries are a stack, in reverse chronological order. Subentries are likewise a reverse chronological stack. Placestamps assume the hostname@domain:port formalism, where hostname is my operator ID blairmunroakusa, domain is my location in spacetime, and port is my contextual point of interface at said location (example, port=south-table, domain=1357Sat.15Oct22.anch.AK, thus this paragraph placestamp is `blairmunroakusa@1357Sat.15Oct22.anch.AK:south-table`).
