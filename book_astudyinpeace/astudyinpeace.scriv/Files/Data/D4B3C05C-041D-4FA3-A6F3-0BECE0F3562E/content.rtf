\f0\b\fs22 \cf0 piecebrain
\f1\b0 \
This is one of three components that make up a piece computer. The piecebrain makes decisions about how a piece computer should function (managing inputs, outputs, and inner workings). The default piecebrain is the Human brain, and by definition it is impossible to have a piecebrain without a Human brain. The piecebrain is analogous to the processor in a modern computer, but also includes the computer operator. 
\f2\i usage: my piecebrain is bad at thinking about math, so I added Wolfram Alpha to my piecebrain to help me figure out how many different ways I can arrange the pieces in my world.

pieceprocess\

\f1\b0 This is one of three components that make up a piece computer. The pieceprocess in a piece computer is one aspect or facet of the universal piece, which is the sum of all peace processes running in a given moment. The pieceprocess is analogous to a process in a modern computer, but there is only one. 
\f2\i usage:
\f1\i0  
\f2\i My piece computer runs my personal pieceprocess, which is what helps manage my world's pieces, constantly optimizing their arrangement and presence.\

\f0\b piecespace\

\f1\b0 This is one of three components that make up a piece computer. The piecespace is where all the pieces are stored, and in general this is the ambient environment that surrounds us. The piecespace is analogous to the memory in a modern computer (all the different types). Because the Human brain is a prerequisite component in any piece computer, part of a computer's piecespace will exist as the Human brain's memory itself. 
\f2\i usage: My memory often fails me, so I  leave physical clues--or pointers--in my surrounding piecespace to remind me of important things I need to do.

\f0\b WE / US
\f1\b0 \
This is the inclusive combination of 
\f0\b I
\f1\b0 , 
\f0\b we
\f1\b0 , 
\f0\b Humanity
\f1\b0 , and 
\f0\b any intelligent beings with humane quality
\f1\b0 . In other words, WE represents the three scopes of interest considered together, 
\f0\b individual
\f1\b0 , 
\f0\b local 
\f2\i\b0 (community)
\f1\i0 , and 
\f0\b global
\f1\b0 . US is the direct object form of WE. 
\f2\i usage: WE should do something epic and noble. (This translates to: I, my community, my nation, my people, and Humanity at large should do something epic and noble. usage: Peace should explicitly matter to US. (This translates to: Peace should explicitly matter to me, my community, my nation, my people, and Humanity at large.)\

\f0\i0\b the Wilder-ness\

\f1\b0 This is the quality of being wilder. If something is wilder than wild, then there is still always something beyond that is wilder eve. This space as a whole, is the Wilder-ness. Beyond the conceivable universe lies the Wilder-ness}
