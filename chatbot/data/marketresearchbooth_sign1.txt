MARKET RESEARCH BOOTH

This is one of the earlier synopses of the time machine for peace social invention program. It was written in sharpie marker on a piece of cardboard.

Hi! I'm Blair.

I'm a conceptual peace artist/architect
(and peace systems engineer and theoretical peace physicist)
(formally trained in electrical engineering).

THE MOST I CAN DO IS START A CONVERSATION
...I HOPE IT TURNS INTO MOVEMENT TOWARD HUMAN SOLIDARITY AND UNITY...

(! Not _A_ movement ...need to mitigate against mob-mind perversions and distortions.)

I'm inventing a new kind of time machine. (And I could use your help!)
It's called a 'world piece computer'.
I want to network world piece computers to form the world's largest supercomputer:
THE UNIVERSAL PIECE COMPUTER.

I think inventing a time machine is the best chance we stand to accelerate the advent of genuine world peace.

I believe world peace is a prerequisite for solving our hardest (existential) problems.

But 'world peace' (which is more of an ideal or direction) is a super loaded concept (and quite unrealistic in the kumbaya sense) so I advocate for that I call 'the universal piece'.

The universal piece is an inclusive process that links all our different worlds together in iteratively better ways. It does so in a way that makes cooperation easier, by enabling more effective communication and action, to solve our hardest problems together, one bit at a time. Maintaining this process in a way that continuously evolves is how we can point our present worlds toward better futures...AND THEN GET THERE.

THIS IS THE BIG IDEA UNDERPINNING THE TIME MACHINE FOR PEACE (The universal piece computer ie the global peace system). 
(well, without answering the fun/hard question of 'how'.)
