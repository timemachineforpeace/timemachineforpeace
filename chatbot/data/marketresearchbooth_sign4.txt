Hi! I'm Blair.

For now, the most I can do is start a conversation.

I'm inventing a time machine.
It's called a world piece computer.
I want to network world piece computers (like the internet, but with a unified process) to form a supercomputer called the universal piece computer.

I am here to refine a proposition for connecting Human worlds together in iteratively better ways.

My mission is to accelerate the advent of global peace, and eventually world peace, by running that unified process as what we call 'the universal piece'.

The outcome of the universal piece will be a form of general consilience (ie, the general unification of Human knowledge).

This will likely manifest as an equal-access general education system designed to unify and modify our narratives, and in a way that empowers us as a species to take ownership in guiding our own social evolution towards a future we can agree that we actually want.
