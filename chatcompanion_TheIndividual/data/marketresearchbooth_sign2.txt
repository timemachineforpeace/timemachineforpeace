This is a social invention program I'm trying to get off the ground.

We're actually inventing a new kind of computer.
It helps you process all the pieces in your world.
It's called a "world piece computer".

The big idea is to link all our world piece computers together to build the universal piece computer (a supercomputer).

Then we can use our supercomputer to systematically make our world a better place.

1) --to systematically process all our world pieces,
2) --to get to better futures, better presents, or back to better things.
3) --TOGETHER.

(But not as a movement, rather as individuals side-by-side.)
